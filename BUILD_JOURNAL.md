2. **Font Loading Optimization** - `font-display: swap` prevents layout shifts during font loading
3. **Accessibility First** - Application functions perfectly without specific font files
4. **Documentation Added** - Created README.md in fonts directory explaining fallback strategy

**Technical Decision:**
Instead of requiring specific OpenDyslexic font files, the application uses progressive enhancement:
- Primary: OpenDyslexic (if available)
- Fallback 1: Comic Sans MS (widely available, dyslexia-friendly)  
- Fallback 2: Arial (universal accessibility)
- All fonts maintain high readability for neurodiverse users
