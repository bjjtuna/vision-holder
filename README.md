# Vision Holder

An AI-powered coding assistant designed to help people with ADHD, dyslexia, and those who can't code achieve more control and structure in their development process than traditional "vibe coding" approaches.

## Vision

Vision Holder bridges the gap between no-code solutions and full development by providing:
- **Structured guidance** for people with ADHD who need clear, step-by-step processes
- **Accessible interfaces** designed with dyslexia-friendly principles
- **Controlled creativity** that maintains user agency while providing AI assistance
- **Learning-focused** approach that builds coding confidence over time

## Core Principles

1. **User Control First** - You always maintain control over your project direction
2. **Structured Flexibility** - Clear processes that adapt to your thinking style
3. **Accessibility by Design** - Built for neurodiverse users from the ground up
4. **Progressive Learning** - Grows with your skills, doesn't replace them
