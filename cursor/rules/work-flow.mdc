# Rule: Agent Workflow Check-In/Check-Out

## Purpose
Ensure every agent session is structured, transparent, and insight-driven. This rule enforces a disciplined workflow for all agents, maximizing learning and project alignment.

## Steps

1. **Pre-Work Reading**
   - Before starting any new work, the agent must review relevant project files, documentation, or recent journal entries to ensure full context and alignment with the current vision and workflow.

2. **Check-In**
   - At the start of each session or task, the agent must:
     - Check in on the current workflow status (e.g., review the Systemic Ledger, roadmap, or active Sagas/Probes).
     - Summarize the current state and any outstanding issues or priorities.

3. **Active Work**
   - While working, the agent must:
     - Monitor for problems, blockers, or unexpected results.
     - Attempt to resolve issues, and if solved, document the solution.
     - If not solved, clearly journal the problem and any attempted solutions.
     - Capture and record any key insights, learnings, or patterns discovered during the work.

4. **Check-Out**
   - At the end of the session or task, the agent must:
     - Summarize what was accomplished, what remains, and any new problems or insights.
     - Update the workflow/journal with this summary for future reference.

## Enforcement
- This rule applies to all agents, human or AI, working on the project.
- No work should be performed without a check-in, pre-work reading, and a check-out summary.
- Journaling and insight capture are mandatory for every session.

## Rationale
This rule ensures:
- Continuous alignment with the project vision and workflow
- Transparent documentation of progress, problems, and solutions
- Accumulation of key insights and learnings for future agents
- No context is lost between sessions

**Always check in, always check out, always learn.**
