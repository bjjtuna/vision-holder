# [clarify] Philosophy Foundation

## Core Philosophy

The Vision Holder project is built on the principle that **vision alignment is more important than technical perfection**. Our philosophy centers on creating systems that serve human needs first, with technology as the enabler rather than the driver.

## Key Metaphors

### The Co-Vision Holder
The AI acts as a "co-vision holder" - not just an assistant, but a partner who deeply understands and aligns with the user's unique perspective and goals.

### The Living Ecosystem
Projects are not rigid structures but living ecosystems that can adapt, grow, and evolve while maintaining their core purpose.

### The Systemic Ledger
All decisions, learnings, and progress are recorded in an append-only ledger that serves as both memory and guide.
