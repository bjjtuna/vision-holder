# OpenDyslexic Fonts

The OpenDyslexic font files will fall back to Comic Sans MS and Arial for accessibility.

For production, consider using:
- Google Fonts with OpenDyslexic alternatives
- Web-based font loading from CDN
- Local installation of OpenDyslexic for users

The application is designed to work gracefully without these specific font files.
